         <h2>The Southern Secret Sauce</h2>
         <p>So, your looking to make a <strong>southern claissic?</strong>
        Well you've come to the right place! This down south delight will
        warm you up during the winter and fill bellies all year round!
           
        <strong>Starting</strong> off with a flour base, <em>(rue)</em>,
          cooking down your rue is the first step and your main compnent
           to a good ol fashion gumbo. season if you like or use the flavors
           from all the meats that will be added later. Cooking your rue is simple
           put 1/4 cup of perferred oil in your pot and heat, add 2-3 table spoons <em>(or as needed)</em> 
          of flour to the pot and whiske until golden brown or to disired darkness.
          
          <strong>Next</strong> is the bulk of the southern concoction, <strong>THE MEAT</strong>
        with a mixture of flavors the skys the limit!! from chicken and Sausage
        to a full seafood smorgasbord!! gumbo has everything in it but the kitchen sink!!
        in a seperate pot <em>(or the same pot as the rue, just take the rue out first)</em>
        throw your meats in and brown until tender or when you thtink its ready haha.
          
        <strong>AS</strong> you find your meats being done, your rue ready to go, grab a 5 qt pot,
        <em>(or the biggest pot you have haha)</em>and fill half way with water. once your waters boiling
      throw in you rue and stir until fully combined witht eh water it should should be a dark brown and smelling
    like heaven!! After you have a good boil thrown in your meats and let that boil for 1.5-3 hours. <em>yes we know thats a long time but its well worth the wait!!</em>
          
            <strong>As</strong> that boils all the sweet nothings combind in the pot and make an amazing mixture 
           your taste buds will tahnk you for later! serve over a bed of rice in a bowl and pressto!!</p>
